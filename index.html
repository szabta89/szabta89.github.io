						<b>An Extensible Framework for Variable-Precision Data-Flow Analyses in MPS</b><br/>
						Tamás Szabó, Simon Alperovich, Markus Voelter, and Sebastian Erdweg.<br/>
						In <em>Proceedings of International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)</em>, ACM, 2016.
						[&nbsp;<a href="publications/mps-df-ase.pdf">pdf</a>&nbsp;]
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify">
								Data-flow analyses are used as part of many software engineering
								tasks: they are the foundations of program understanding, refactorings
								and optimized code generation. Similar to general-purpose languages
								(GPLs), state-of-the-art domain-specific languages (DSLs) also require
								sophisticated data-flow analyses.  However, as a consequence of the
								different economies of DSL development and their typically relatively
								fast evolution, the effort for developing and evolving such analyses
								must be lowered compared to GPLs.  This tension can be resolved with
								dedicated support for data-flow analyses in language workbenches.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								In this tool paper we present MPS-DF, which is the component in the MPS
								language workbench that supports the definition of data-flow analyses
								for DSLs. Language developers can define data-flow graph builders
								declaratively as part of a language definition and compute analysis
								results efficiently based on these data-flow graphs. MPS-DF is
								extensible such that it does not compromise the support for language
								composition in MPS. Additionally, clients of MPS-DF analyses can run the
								analyses with variable precision thus trading off precision for
								performance. This allows clients to tailor an analysis to a particular
								use case.

						<b>Developing and Visualizing Live Model Queries</b><br/>
						Zoltán Újhelyi, Tamás Szabó, István Ráth, Dániel Varró.<br/>
						In <em>Proceedings of Analysis of Model Transformations (AMT)</em>, ACM, 2012.
						[&nbsp;<a href="publications/incquery-qe-amt.pdf">pdf</a>&nbsp;]
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify">
								Several important tasks performed by model driven development tools — 
								such as well-formedness constraint validation or model transformations — 
								rely on evaluating model queries. If the model changes rapidly or frequently, 
								it is beneficial to provide live queries that automatically propagate 
								these model changes into the query results. To ease the development and 
								debugging of live queries, the development environment should provide a 
								way to evaluate the query results continuously, helping to understand how the created query works.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								This paper presents a generic live model query visualizer that displays 
								and updates the query results depending on their source models. It has 
								been implemented for the EMF-IncQuery framework and presented here 
								for validating BPMN models.

						<b>Incremental pattern matching for the efficient computation of transitive closure</b><br/>
						Gábor Bergmann, István Ráth, Tamás Szabó, Paolo Torrini, Dániel Varró.<br/>
						In <em>Proceedings of International Conference on Graph Transformations (ICGT)</em>, Springer-Verlag, 2012.
						[&nbsp;<a href="publications/incquery-tc-icgt.pdf">pdf</a>&nbsp;]
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify">
								Pattern matching plays a central role in graph transformations as a key 
								technology for computing local contexts in which transformation rules are to be applied. 
								Incremental matching techniques offer a performance advantage over the search-based approach, 
								in a number of scenarios including on-the-fly model synchronization, model simulation, 
								view maintenance, well-formedness checking and state space traversal. However, the incremental 
								computation of transitive closure in graph pattern matching has started to be investigated 
								only recently. In this paper, we propose multiple algorithms for the efficient computation of 
								generalized transitive closures. As such, our solutions are capable of computing reachability 
								regions defined by simple graph edges as well as complex binary relationships defined by 
								graph patterns, that may be used in a wide spectrum of modeling problems. We also report on 
								experimental evaluation of our prototypical implementation, carried out within the context 
								of a stochastic system simulation case study.

							<p align="justify">
								Formal verification is becoming a fundamental step
								of safety-critical and model-based software development. As
								part of the verification process, model checking is one of the
								current advanced techniques to analyze the behavior of a
								system. In this paper, we examine an existing parallel model
								checking algorithm and we propose improvements to eliminate
								some computational bottlenecks. Our measurements show that

								EMF-IncQuery is a high-performance framework for incremental graph pattern matching over EMF models. It comes with an expressive declarative 
								language to define patterns over the models and the query engine incrementally processes the changes of the model to keep the query results 
								up-to-date. In the context of the project, I have developed the dedicated transitive closure support and implemented the Query Explorer component 
								which is widely used to debug the graph patterns during development.

								IncA is a program analysis framework. It comes with a DSL for the definition of program analyses 
								and the runtime system evaluates program analyses incrementally to achieve the performance that is needed for 
								real-time feedback in IDEs. When code gets changed, the IncA runtime system incrementally updates the results instead of 
								the repeated recomputation from scratch. IncA program analysis code is translated into graph patterns and we reuse existing incremental 
								graph pattern matching solutions to evaluate the analysis code on the AST of the analyzed program.
