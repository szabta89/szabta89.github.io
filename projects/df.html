        <p align="justify">MPS-DF is the data-flow support in the MPS language workbench. It supports the definition 
        and efficient execution of <b>data-flow analyses</b>. Users of MPS-DF first define <b>data-flow builders</b> for the analyzed 
        language. These builders contribute subgraphs to the <b>data-flow graph (DFG)</b>, an intermediate program representation 
        encoding the data-flow of the analyzed program. MPS-DF then supports defining data-flow analyses, on the DFG, which 
        compute some data-flow specific knowledge (e.g. which variables are initialized) about the program. These data-flow 
        analyses are static program analyses, which derive the knowl- edge without actually running the analyzed program. Finally, 
        existing MPS components, such as program validators, transformations or refactorings, make use of this knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>
        MPS-DF has two important characteristics: extensibility and variable precision.
        <ul>
        	<li align="justify"><b>Extensibility</b> is motivated by the fact that MPS-based languages are extensible themselves (wrt. syntax, semantics, IDE support). 
        	It comes in two flavours: first, builders enable extensibility of the DFG in the face of language extensions of the analyzed language. 
        	This means that an existing analysis immediately works on an extended program if the concepts in the language extension also define 
        	builders and thus contribute subgraphs to the DFG. The second flavour of extensibility supports augmenting the DFG for a particular 
        	analysis with custom nodes that encode specific knowledge about the analyzed program and potentially override an analysis result based on that knowledge.</li>
        	<li align="justify"><b>Variable precision</b> considers performance trade-offs: real-time checks in the IDE must run fast, possibly compromising on precision, 
        	whereas a more precise, but slower, analysis is needed during compilation. We achieve the variable precision by switching between 
        	intra-procedural analysis (within a sin- gle function definition) and inter-procedural analysis (across function definitions). 
        	Switching is achieved by constructing two different DFGs, but running the same analyses.</li>
        </ul>

            <li align="justify">MPS-DF provides a DSL for the definition of data-flow graph builders. Builders contribute subgraphs to the data-flow graph, 
                which is an intermediate program representation encoding the control flow of the program together with the data-flow.</li>
            <li align="justify">MPS-DF provides a DSL for the definition of data-flow analyses which derive some data-flow specific knowledge on the DFG of the analyzed program.</li>
            <li align="justify">MPS-DF provides extensive support for extensibility which aligns perfectly with the support for language extensions in MPS.</li>
            <li align="justify">Data-flow analyses can be evaluated with varying precision levels; clients can switch between a more precise and potentially slower inter-procedural 
                analysis and a less precise but faster intra-procedural analysis. </li>
            <li align="justify">Results of MPS-DF analyses can immediately be used in already existing MPS components: validation rules, generators, refactorings.</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
        At the time of the ASE submission only the intra-procedural part of MPS-DF is integrated into MPS. The inter-procedural part is 
        part of the mbeddr project and it is being integrated into core MPS during the summer. The plan is that the upcoming major release of 
        MPS (version 3.4) will already contain all MPS-DF components. </p>
        
        <p align="justify">You can download the corresponding MPS version from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7n4tuU3Ty7eZkZCNFQ4RDBSdDg&usp=sharing">here</a> 
        and you may find the <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/MPSD33/MPS+User's+Guide">MPS user guide</a> interesting as well.</p>
        
		<p align="justify">You can obtain the inter-procedural part along with the case studies from the <a href="https://www.mbeddr.com">mbeddr</a> repository. Simply check out the <code>feature/mps-df</code> branch which 
		also contains the example projects used in the paper and in the above video for demonstration. The relevant MPS modules for the inter-procedural 
		data-flow analyses are the <code>com.mbeddr.mpsutil.dataflow</code> language and the <code>com.mbeddr.mpsutil.dataflow.runtime</code> solution from the mpsutil project in mbeddr. </p>

    <div class="content">
    	<h2 id="case_studies">3 - Case studies </h2>
    	
    	<p align="justify">We have developed several data-flow analyses for C in mbeddr and for Java in MPS itself. The analyses implementations are readily available 
    	once you obtained the above mentioned software components. 
    	
    	In order to find these analysis implementations you simply need to press CTRL (or CMD on Mac) + N in MPS and type in the analysis name. 
    	MPS will automatically jump to the declaration of the analyses. The name of the analyses are given below in parentheses. In the following we give details about four analyses.</p>
    	
    	<h3>Points-to Analysis for C (PointsTo)</h3>
        
        <p align="justify"><b>Synopsis</b>: Derives the possible targets of a pointer typed variable at a program point (DFG node).</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Lattice element</b>: <code>Map&lt;node&lt;Var&gt;, Set&lt;node&lt;Var&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> which represents a mapping from variables to set of variables.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Analysis direction</b>: forward, because the points-to relationship is something that happened in the past and we carry that over to later nodes in the DFG.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Must/May property</b>: must analysis, because we want this analysis to be a sound analysis, claiming that a variable points to another only if this relationship holds
		 on all execution paths that lead to a program point.</p>
    	
        <h3>Initialized Variables Analysis for C (InitializedVariables)</h3>
        
        <p align="justify"><b>Synopsis</b>: Derives which variables are definitely initialized at a program point (DFG node).</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Lattice element</b>: <code>Set&lt;node&lt;Var&gt;&gt;</code> which represents the set of initialized variables.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Analysis direction</b>: forward, because the initialized property is something that happened in the past and we carry that over to later nodes in the DFG.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Must/May property</b>: must analysis, because we want this analysis to be a sound analysis, claiming the initialized property about a variable only when it 
		is guaranteed to have been initialized on all execution paths that lead to a program point.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Custom instructions</b>: The analysis uses only one custom instruction, <code>defInit(node&lt;Var&gt; target)</code>, which represents a definitely initialized variable. 
		The presence of the custom instruction in the DFG overrides the analysis result by considering the target variable initialized.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Other</b>: The analysis uses the results of the points-to analysis to know which pointer typed variables point to which other variables.
		This is necessary, because whenever an assignment of the form <code>*a = 10;</code> happens, we do not directly initialize the variable 
		<code>a</code>, but those variables which <code>a</code> may point to. </p>
		
        <h3>Liveness Analysis for C (Liveness)</h3>
        
        <p align="justify"><b>Synopsis</b>: The analysis derives which variables are live at a program point (DFG node), 
        where live means that the current value of the variable may be read during the remaining execution of the program. </p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Lattice element</b>: <code>Set&lt;node&lt;Var&gt;&gt;</code> which represents the set of live variables.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Analysis direction</b>: backward, because the current value of a variable may be read in the future, thus we need to propagate the information from the back to the front.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Must/May property</b>: may analysis, because we consider a variable live if it is read on any of the succeeding execution paths.</p>
        
        <!--<h3>Null Analysis for Java (Nullable)</h3>
        
        <p align="justify"><b>Synopsis</b>: The analysis derives whether the variable or expression is definitely null, definitely not null or can be null.</p>
        <p>Its result may help preventing programming errors  i.e. calling the instance method on the object that was assigned to <code>null</code></p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Lattice element</b>: <code>Map&lt;node, NullableState&gt;</code> which represents the state of expression/variable at each program point
            <p>Nullable state can be one of the follows: NOTNULL, NULL, NULLABLE</p>
        <p>
            <code>NOTNULL</code> - means that expression/variable is definitely not null at this program point.
        <p>
            <code>NULL</code> - expression/variable is definitely null.
        <p>
            <code>NULLABLE</code> - expression/variable can be null.
        <p>Those elements themselves define the lattice</p>
        <img src="df/NULLABLE_3.png" style="width:400px;height:266px;">
        <p> </p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Analysis direction</b>:forward, because the state of the expression/variable depends on what it was assigned to which happened in the past. </p>
		<p align="justify"><b>Must/May property</b>:must analysis, because we want this analysis to be a sound analysis, claiming that variable is definitely null/not null only if this fact holds on
            all execution paths that lead to a program point. If on the on path the variable is definitely null and on the other it is definitely not null that means that at the program point it is nullable</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>Custom instructions</b>:The analysis uses three custom instructions: <code>nullable</code>, <code>notNull</code> and <code>null</code>
            with the parameter of expression.

        <p><code>nullable</code> is inserted to the graph when the variable is annotated with the<code>@Nullable</code> annotation.
        <p><code>notNull</code> is inserted if the variable is annotated with the <code>@NotNull</code> annotation or
            the variable/expression is assigned to the definitely not null expression, i.e. <code>new Object</code>.</p>
        <p><code>null</code> is inserted for the variables and expressions assigned to <code>null</code> literal.</p>

        <p>The analysis handles these custom instructions and set the corresponding state to the variables/expression. Also it handles non-custom <code>write</code> instructions and assigns the
            state of the <code>write</code> value to the variable which is written</p>
